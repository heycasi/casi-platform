## 🌍 Mission
> Empower every streamer to build deeper connections with their audiences through AI-powered chat intelligence — helping them grow sustainably, understand their communities, and never miss a moment that matters.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 1: PREP

### 🎯 Target Audience
**Who they are**
- Streamers on Twitch (and later Kick/YouTube) averaging 50–500 viewers
- Age 18–35, tech-savvy early adopters
- Turning streaming from passion → career

**They feel**
- Overwhelmed keeping up with chat
- Frustrated missing audience questions
- Burnt out from inconsistent growth
- Unsure what’s working or why

**They want**
- More engagement + loyal community
- Emotional understanding of their audience
- Smarter, sustainable growth

**Audience segments**
| Segment | Description | Pain | Goal |
|----------|--------------|------|------|
| Rising Streamer | 20–150 avg viewers | Growth plateau | Find what drives retention |
| Established Streamer | 150–500 avg viewers | Audience disconnect | Build loyalty, monetisation |
| Data-Driven Creator | Obsessed with metrics | Lacks emotional context | Merge data + empathy |
| Community Builder | Focus on vibes | Hard to measure success | Simple summaries & feedback |

---

### 😫 The Problem (Without Casi)
- Miss key chat messages → lost engagement
- No visibility into sentiment or mood
- No post-stream data to act on
- Too many disconnected tools
- Growth decisions based on guesswork

---

### 🧍 Buyer Psychology
| Type | Needs | Decision Driver |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Rational (Analytical) | ROI proof, metrics | Data & dashboards |
| Emotional (Community) | Connection & trust | Testimonials & stories |
| Aspirational (Growth) | Career freedom | Vision & confidence |

**Objections → Reframes**
| Objection | Response |
|------------|-----------|
| “No time.” | Casi runs automatically — zero setup. |
| “Too small.” | Start early; scale insights as you grow. |
| “Already have StreamElements.” | That shows numbers; we show meaning. |
| “Twitch safety?” | 100 % API-approved & compliant. |

---

### 🧠 Competitive Differentiation
| Competitor | Limitation | Casi Difference |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| StreamElements | Utility-based | Adds emotional intelligence |
| Streamlabs | Data overload | Actionable coaching |
| TwitchTracker | Stats-only | Real-time + post insights |
| Moobot/Nightbot | Commands only | Community intelligence |
| RewardMore | Loyalty focus | Identifies superfans early |

> **Casi = Stream Intelligence, not another overlay.**
