## 📊 SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Layout**: Left-aligned text with icons/emoji

**Title**: "Streamers Are Flying Blind"

**Content** (3 pain points with icons):

```
😫 CHAT OVERLOAD
Streams get 100+ viewers. Chat scrolls too fast.
Miss important questions and supporters.
→ Result: Viewers feel ignored, streamers burn out

📊 NO INSIGHTS
Stream ends. No idea how it went.
Just guessing what works.
→ Result: Can't improve, stuck at same viewer count for months

💰 LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE
Can't understand foreign viewers (Spanish, French, etc.)
Don't know who superfans are until they stop donating.
→ Result: Miss revenue opportunities, lose VIPs
```

**Design Notes**:

- Each pain point in a subtle purple card (rgba(105, 50, 255, 0.1))
- Icons/emoji large and prominent
- Text hierarchy: Bold problem → regular explanation → italic result
- Purple left border on each card (4px solid #6932FF)

Hi, I'm Connor 👋

BACKGROUND
• 7+ years in luxury fashion (Burberry, ESCADA)
• Currently: Data & AI Governance in Media
• Gamer with friends who stream

WHY CASI
I saw streamers struggle with what I'm good at:
turning messy data into clear insights.

I built HeyCasi from scratch — product, backend,
frontend, integrations, all of it. Solo.

WHAT I BRING
• Technical: Built the entire platform
• Creative: Brand, design, product vision
• Hustle: Move fast, learn faster

WHAT I NEED
Someone who challenges my ideas, brings focus
to growth, and knows how to build communities.

I don't need a "yes person" — I need a partner.
```

**Design Notes**:

- Photo on left (40% of slide)
- Purple gradient border around photo
- Text on right (60% of slide)
- Conversational, authentic tone
- Emojis for personality
