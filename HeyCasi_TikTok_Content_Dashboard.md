## 🧩 Reusable Script Frameworks

### 🎥 Hook → Body → CTA Template

**Hook (0–2s):** Relatable question or surprising fact.  
**Body (3–18s):** Visual demonstration or story moment (Casi solving a problem).  
**CTA (19–25s):** Invite viewers to act — Follow, Beta link, Comment “BETA”.

### 🔁 Variations

- **Pain Point → Solution:** “Tired of missing chat questions?” ➜ show chaos ➜ show Casi.
- **Behind the Scenes:** “How we built Casi to understand your chat.” ➜ dev b‑roll ➜ friendly outro.
- **Educational:** “Quiet chat? Here’s why that’s data gold.” ➜ 3 tips ➜ Casi vibe meter.
- **Community:** “We’re building Casi with you.” ➜ beta testers montage ➜ CTA to join.

---

## 🎨 Brand Consistency Notes

- Alternate **Dark / Light gradient backgrounds** to mirror Instagram grid.
- Keep **sub‑text** on screen (Casi’s voice or caption style) for clarity.
- Use the same **3D render style** for Casi (white suit, teal heart, pink accents).
- Include logo watermark bottom right in every video.
- Music tone: chill, techy, hopeful — no harsh bass or memes unless deliberate.
