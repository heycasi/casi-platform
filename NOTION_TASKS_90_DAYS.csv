Maker Comment:
'Hey Product Hunt! 👋 Connor here, maker of Casi.

I built this because I kept missing questions in my own streams. Chat moves fast, I'd get focused on gameplay, and by the time I looked at chat the question was gone.

Casi solves this by:
1. Watching chat for you
2. Flagging every question
3. Tracking sentiment in real-time
4. Emailing you a full report after

It's like having a chat analyst watching your stream.

Would love your feedback! AMA 🚀'

(Thread)'

Tweet 2: The Problem
'I built Casi because I kept missing questions in my own streams.

Fast chat = missed engagement.

Decided to fix it for myself. Figured other streamers had same problem.'

Tweet 3: Week 1 Reality Check
'Week 1 was humbling:
- Sent 50 DMs → 3 responses (6%)
- Posted on Reddit → 2 upvotes
- 1 TikTok → 47 views
- New signups: 2

Reality: Nobody cares about your product. They care about their problems.'

Tweet 4: The Pivot
'Changed strategy Week 2:
- Stopped pitching product
- Started solving specific problems
- Personalized every message
- Provided value first

Result: 20% response rate'

Tweet 5: What Worked
'Best channels:
1. Personal Twitter DMs (20% response)
2. Discord (if you provide value first)
3. Product Hunt (50+ signups in 1 day)

What flopped:
- Reddit (unless you provide data/value)
- Generic outreach
- Mass emails'

Tweet 6: Surprising Insight
'Biggest surprise: Streamers care MORE about:
- Missing questions (huge pain)
- Sentiment tracking (unexpected interest)

And LESS about:
- Post-stream reports (nice to have)
- Advanced analytics (overwhelming)

Lesson: Build what they ask for, not what you think they need.'

'Week 1: 2 signups
Week 2: 8 signups
Week 3: [X] signups

Current MRR: $[X]
Active users: [X]
Response rate: 20%

Small numbers, but growing. That's what matters.'

Tweet 8: Hardest Part
'Hardest thing: Staying motivated when nobody cares.

You DM 20 people. 18 ignore you. 2 respond. 1 signs up.

That 1 signup is what keeps you going.

Building in public helps. Accountability.'
