## **Session 3 - October 23, 2025**
**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Focus:** Activity Feed Implementation & EventSub Webhook Integration

### **What We Built**

**🎯 Complete Activity Feed System**
- ✅ Implemented real-time Activity Feed component showing stream events
- ✅ Created `/api/webhooks/twitch-events` endpoint to receive EventSub webhooks
- ✅ Built webhook signature verification using HMAC SHA256
- ✅ Created event storage in `stream_events` table
- ✅ Implemented real-time polling (10-second intervals)
- ✅ Added visual event cards with icons, colors, and timestamps

**🔐 User Authorization & Token Management**
- ✅ Updated Twitch OAuth scopes to request all required permissions:
  - `channel:read:subscriptions` - for sub events
  - `moderator:read:followers` - for follow events
  - `bits:read` - for bit/cheer events
- ✅ Stored Twitch access_token and refresh_token in Supabase user metadata
- ✅ Updated auth callback to store tokens on every login
- ✅ Rewritten `/api/subscribe-user-events` to use user access tokens

**🎭 Hybrid Admin System (Option 1)**
- ✅ Created `/api/admin/setup-raid-subscription` - admins can monitor any streamer's raids
- ✅ Created `/api/check-streamer-authorization` - checks if streamer has authorized
- ✅ Added authorization status banner in Activity Feed
- ✅ Auto-setup raid subscriptions when admin enters channel name
- ✅ Clear UX showing "Available: Raids" vs "Requires auth: Subs, Follows, Bits"

**📊 Event Types Supported**
- ⭐ `channel.subscribe` - New subscriptions
- 🎁 `channel.subscription.message` - Resubs with messages
- ❤️ `channel.follow` - New followers
- 💎 `channel.cheer` - Bit donations
- ⚔️ `channel.raid` - Incoming raids

### **What We Fixed**

**🐛 Critical Webhook Verification Failure**
- ❌ **Root Cause #1:** Webhook URL was `https://heycasi.com` but Vercel redirects to `https://www.heycasi.com`
  - Twitch sends webhook to `heycasi.com`
  - Gets HTTP 307 redirect
  - Twitch doesn't follow redirects → verification fails
- ✅ **Solution:** Updated all webhook URLs to use `https://www.heycasi.com` (with www)

- ❌ **Root Cause #2:** EventSub subscription types require different authorization:
  - Subs/Follows/Bits need **user access tokens** (not app tokens)
  - Was using app tokens for all subscriptions → forbidden errors
- ✅ **Solution:** Implemented user token storage and usage in subscription API

**🔧 Other Fixes**
- ✅ Fixed Activity Feed to query by `channel_name` instead of email (works for admins)
- ✅ Fixed admin session persistence - saves `adminChannel` in localStorage
- ✅ Fixed session save logic to allow admin saves without sessionId
- ✅ Removed chat feed auto-scroll (was scrolling to old messages)

### **What We Tested**

**✅ Webhook Verification**
- Tested signature calculation with HMAC SHA256
- Verified webhook endpoint responds with challenge
- Confirmed HTTP 200 response with correct www domain
- Created test subscription for fifakillvizualz - successfully enabled!

**✅ Subscription Creation**
- Deleted all 61 failed subscriptions
- Created fresh raid subscription - status: **enabled** ✅
- Confirmed webhook verification passed

**📋 Scripts Created for Testing**
- `scripts/check-subscriptions.sh` - List all EventSub subscriptions
- `scripts/delete-all-subscriptions.sh` - Clean up failed subscriptions
- `scripts/create-subscription.sh` - Create subscriptions for testing
- `scripts/test-webhook.sh` - Test webhook with proper HMAC signature

### **What We Deployed**

**Commit 1:** `0b39f5a` - "fix: Update webhook URL to use www.heycasi.com to avoid redirect"
- Fixed webhook URL in all scripts
- Added subscription management scripts

**Commit 2:** `78bf1a3` - "feat: Enable all Activity Feed event types with user authorization"
- OAuth scopes updated
- Token storage implemented
- User-authorized subscriptions API
- All 5 event types supported

**Commit 3:** `2e6c70a` - "feat: Hybrid Activity Feed for admins - raid events without authorization"
- Admin raid subscription API
- Authorization check API
- Activity Feed authorization notice
- Auto-setup for admin channels

### **🏗️ Technical Architecture**

**EventSub Webhook Flow:**
```
Twitch → HTTPS POST → www.heycasi.com/api/webhooks/twitch-events
         ↓
    Verify HMAC signature
         ↓
    Parse event type
         ↓
    Store in stream_events table
         ↓
    Activity Feed polls every 10s
         ↓
    Display to user in real-time
```

**Authorization Levels:**
```
App Access Token:
  ✅ channel.raid

User Access Token (requires streamer login):
  ✅ channel.subscribe
  ✅ channel.subscription.message
  ✅ channel.follow
  ✅ channel.cheer
```

### **📊 Database Changes**
- Using existing `stream_events` table
- Storing events with:
  - `channel_name` (for admin queries)
  - `channel_email` (for user queries)
  - `event_type`, `event_data`, `event_timestamp`
  - `user_id`, `user_name`, `user_display_name`

### **🎯 Status at End of Session**

**✅ Fully Working:**
- Webhook verification passing
- Raid events enabled for fifakillvizualz
- Activity Feed component complete
- Admin hybrid system operational
- Session persistence for admins
- Authorization status checking

**⏳ Pending Testing (Tomorrow):**
- millzaatv login and authorization
- Full event types (subs, follows, bits, raids)
- Real-time event display during live stream
- Admin monitoring of millzaatv's channel

**🎓 Key Learnings:**
1. Twitch doesn't follow HTTP redirects during webhook verification
2. EventSub requires different token types for different event subscriptions
3. User access tokens must be stored and refreshed for ongoing access
4. Hybrid approach gives admins immediate value (raids) while encouraging full authorization
